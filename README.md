## Frontend setup

Within the `frontend` directory, follow these steps:

1. If you don't have `yarn` installed, use the following command to install it globally:
   ```bash
   $ npm install --global yarn
   ```   
   You can find download instructions for `npm` [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   $ yarn start
   ```

You can also get the production version by running `yarn build`. The files will be in the `build` folder.
